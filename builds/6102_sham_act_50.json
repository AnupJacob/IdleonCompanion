  "comment_two": "Put 1 point into active skills, maxing \"Power Overwhelming \" then putting 40 points each into \"Individual insight\" and \"Knowledge is power\" is probably gonna take all your points at this level.",
  "comment_three": "Put 20-30 points into \"Virile Vials\" (skip this part if you dont have many green vials.)\nGo for 1 in each active skill, then you want to max \"Earlier Education\", after maxing it you can start adding more points to \"Crazy Concotions\"",
