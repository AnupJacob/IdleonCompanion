  "comment_two": "Max \"Energy bolt\" and \"Mini Fireball\"\nWith \"Power Overwhelming\" and some points in \"Knowledge is Power\" you can max afk gains with just tab1&2",
  "comment_three": "Max \"Bubble Breakthrough\"\n*1= pick one to max, eventually all 4 will be maxed. Sharing Smarts and Brew Speed first, depending on if you want XP or brew speed ",
  "notes": "You can go for alchemy talents on tab 3, because you max gains with dmg from tab 1&2, which makes it super good for both leveling and alchemy progress.\nActive Skills are a direct mutiplier to AFK damage. If you get your minimum damage combined with active multipliers to the monsters HP, you are damage capped.\nMin Damage to cap Sand Giants with these active skills: 4200",
