  "comment_one": "Priority is \"Book of the Wise\" then dmg talents.\n*1 = As much as needed for the zone you want to afk in. Your goal should be 0 points, achieved from alchemy. Aim for 1.5x accuracy for precision power on tab 3.",
  "comment_two": "Go for 1 in each active skill, then you want to max \"Carry A Big Stick\", then mix \"Absolute Unit\" and \"Strength in numbers\".\nAs you gain more levels, considering putting points in Whirl.",
  "comment_three": "Shockwave is all you need here for active clearing. Depending on map \"Daggerang\" can be good or bad so 1+ point as you see fit. If you have 1.5 times req accuracy, max precision power. Leaving you to get 100 points into Back to Basics to help tab 2",
  "notes": "Squire can be a great active class due to weapon hitting multiple targets along with great AOE active skills. ",
