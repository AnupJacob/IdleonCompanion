  "comment_one": "*1= Boost str to have 405 accuracy (Sand castles) as thats the zone you will be spending quite some time at this level.\n",
  "comment_two": "*1= As much as needed for 130% with 5-15 points in \"Featherweight\". 130% is to get to speedna breakpoint, AFK MS cap is 200%+ at sand giants\nYou want to level up \"Piercing Arrow\" and \"Kung Fu Kick\" to about 40. \"High polymer limbs\" and \"Veins of the Infernal\" have less priority here.",
  "comment_three": "Level up \"Homing Arrow\" and \"Magic shortbow\" to around 40, \"Extended  rangeo\" still to 1.\n\"SpeeDna\" should be at at least level 40 to be effective.",
  "notes": "Active Skills directly increase AFK damage (multiplicative). The damage cap for a zone is the Monsterâ€™s HP. AFK damage increases above this cap will not increase your gains. AFK Damage = Minimum damage * Active Skill AFK multiplier\nMin Damage to cap Sand Castles with these active skills: 2100",
